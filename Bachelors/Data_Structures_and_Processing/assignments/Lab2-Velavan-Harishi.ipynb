    "We have suggested to write down a function that could read the contents of a file and returns a list of records.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest to break the task down into even smaller tasks or sub-tasks.  For example, we could use the `readlines()` method to read all the lines of the file into a `list` object.  This is easier.  If you look at an element of this list, you may notice that it is a `str` and contains a record together with some characters that we do not need, for example, the spaces or the braces `{`, `}`, or even the newline character `\\n`. Therefore, at this point, we should concentrate on working on a helpful utility that could parse the line and return a `dict` element.  If we succeed in this, then we can use an iterative structure--the `for` loop, together with the newly defined utility to obtain the list of records as we need it.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let us write our observations and write utilities to act on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The line contains the characters `{`, `}` and `\\n`, which we do not need.  This means that we need to write down a function that would remove them.  The utility should return the cleaned string.\n",
    "\n",
    "* After we have removed the undesired characters, the new string should look like the following\n",

    "    \n",
    "* In the cleaned line, we have a different parts that are meant to be the `key-value` pair for the `dict` object--our record.  We see that these are separated by a `,`.  Therefore, we need to find a way to break the string into several different parts and obtain a list of strings containing these `key-value` strings.  A helpful `str` method for such a purpose is the `split()`, which takes a string argument and splits that string at exactly that and returns a list. In our case, we want to split at `,`, therefore, we would use `split(\",\")` on the new line.  Our record after applying the utlity would look like the following.\n",

    "  Notice that the second element in the above list is `' \"title\": \"The data science design manual\"'`. It has an extra white space at the beginning of the string.  We should make sure that our utility function takes care of it by removing the leading or the trailing spaces.  We do not know how many spaces there are, but they need to be removed.  A useful method for removing leading or trailing space is `strip()`. This method does not take any argument and removes the leading and the trailing spaces from a string, regardless of their number.\n",

We could divide this task into subtasks, where we first concentrate on a member of a list which should provide the `key-value` pair.  For example, let us concentrate on the string `'\"title\": \"The data science design manual\"`.  There might be several ways to go forward from here.  But one interesting way is to use our previosly defined utility which splitted the given string at `,`, removed the leading and trailing spaces, and returned a list.  Notice that we need the same utility but with a small change that the character at which we want to split now is not `,`, but it is `:`.  This takes us one step back, and motivates us to add the splitting charachter a part of our input parameters of our utility, because it would then provide us more control.\n",

We can then use our given string together with the `in` operator to determine the corresponding boolean value.  `True` would mean that the the `record` matches and we should append it to a temporary list that we are going to return.  We append using the `list` method `append()`. If `False` is returned, then it means that we ignore it."
