    "\n",
    "1. Press the `install requirements` button above to install the required packages.  See the `requirements.txt` for list of packages to be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make sure that you are following the conventions.  For examples, `import pandas as pd`, which imports pandas packages and sets the abbreviation for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Do not import the packages without the short names.  Doing so might lead to a namespace conflict, or unintended uses of functions coming from two libraries as a part of different implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We are assigning `None` to variables and use `pass` in the body of the functions, where we expect a solution from you.  Please replace these values and statements with your solution."

There are other ways to store such data too, for example as an `xml` format, to name only another one beside `json`.  You might have noticed as we have imported the data that it was presented in a tabular format, and it was done by assigning some `NaN` value to some of the entries, because the corresponding values were missing.  For example, the `\"Quiz Show\"` has `\"genre\"` `NaN`.  Compare it with the json file, where `\"Quiz Show\"`, does not have any value for `\"genre\"`.\n",
