When comparing the original Heap Sort with its Bottom-up Heap Sort variant for input sequences of 
different lengths, including larger input sequences, several observations can be made.
The original Heap Sort typically performs better on smaller input sequences due to its 
efficient build and heapify operations, but as the input size increases, the overhead of 
heapifying and rebuilding the entire heap becomes more significant, impacting performance.
Conversely, the Bottom-up Heap Sort variant may show improved performance on larger input 
sequences due to its optimized approach, reducing the number of comparisons and swaps.
However, this comes with increased implementation complexity compared to the original 
algorithm. Memory usage remains relatively constant for both algorithms, and neither is stable.
