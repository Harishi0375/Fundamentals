## HTTP

HTTP offers the following requests
1. GET
2. POST
3. PUT
4. DELETE 
and more, which are paired with `?` and `&`

GET and POST are used for sending data to the server

## AJAX

stands for asynchronous Javascript and XML and was first offered in 2005

this made it so that now you dont need to reload the whole page but you can load and request for smaller parts of the page to be loaded and fetched making the websites much more responsive.

again AJX can manipulate the DOM tree, meaning dynamically changing pages. 

most common formats for AJAX are
1. JSON
2. XML
3. HTML
4. Plain text


JSON is considered the better XML because it is more readable, lightweight and 10x faster than XML

### Advantages of AJAX

1. Reduced bandwidth usage
2. Separation of data, format, style and function 

### Disadvantages of AJAX

1. Less secure
2. Reliance on JS
3. Response time is slower
4. The changes in a page are not saved in browser history

overall, AJAX allows to add more desktop like features to web apps and is a more lightweight alternative to XML. 

also jQuery is good as it has pretty easy AJAX support
