Extended ERD is one which includes the ISA relation. The ISA relation is similar to inheritance in OOP and shows how entities inherit all of attributes from the parent entity.

There are 2 types, top down  (`Specialisation`) and bottom up
(`Generalisation`)

## Specialisation

This is when you divide a superclass into two more specialised classes. Classic inheritance in OOP

       Person
         |
      âˆ† ISA
       /      \
 Student      Employee

### Benefits
1. More specific
2. Easier and more optimised queries
3. Easier to model real-world variability
4. Best for broad data

```SQL
CREATE TABLE Person(
	PID INT PRIMARY KEY,
	Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
	Age INT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Student(
	PID INT PRIMARY KEY,
	GPA FLOAT NOT NULL
	Major VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
	FOREIGN KEY PID REFERENCES Person(PID),
);

CREATE TABLE Employe(
	PID INT PRIMARY KEY
	Salary INT NOT NULL,
	FOREIGN KEY PID REFERENCES Person(PID)
);

```

now student and employe must also have a Person table to exist and therefore must have a name and and Age

## Generalisation

this is where you have multiple entities with overlapping attributes so you can merge the into a more general entity

Car    Bike
  \        /
   \      /
Vehicle

### Benefits
1. Reduces redundancy
2. Simplifies Schema Maintenance
3. Improves scalability as you can keep on adding entities
4. Best for Fragmented data


## Constraints

Two main types of constraints `Overlap` and `Complete-coverage`

### Overalp

this constrains is basically saying that a parent entity and to how many subclasses it can belong

`allowed overlap` - when a parent entity can belong to two or more child entities

for example if we have a parents vehicle and children truck and car a pickup truck would be both a car and a truck

`disjoint` is when vehicle can belong only to a car or only to a truck

### Complete-coverage

specifies whether every instance of the parent entity **must** belong to at least one subclass

`complete` every person must be an employee or student or both
